# Requiem Bronk Deriv
This mint is based on Requiem's Bronk.

Use devnet config for devnet replacing your wallet address and mint address for the presale token with a token of your choosing. The official candy machine v2 docs describes the process for dropping your own token.

Mainnet was deployed to commit to the bronk dao bit it's a joke. Seriously do not buy using SOL if you missed the mint for $BRONK only.
